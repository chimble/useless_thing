# useless_thing

This useless thing lets a person input names into it and it will
recreate the game of secret santa allowing for each person to 'pick'
a name from a hat at random and then the next person will do the same
until all names have been picked and no names have been picked by
the person with the same name.

Obviously, sometimes you will have failures where a person picks their
own name. In the first setup, this program will output who failed for each
time a name is picked by a person with the same name.

If you comment out the parts indicated and uncomment the other indicated parts
then the program can be setup to run through many many samples of games. When
you run through large numbers of games you can see the average number of failures
over the course of many games. Also you can see the maximum number of failures
from all of the games. Lastly, it will output the average number of failures for
each person in the group.
